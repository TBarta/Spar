<head> Social network for finding sparring partners </head>
<h1> This was my final project of Data4You coding bootcamp in Prague </h1>
<h2> Backend of the website is written in PHP framework Laravel and frontend contains only some basic bootstrap</h2>
<h2> It's fair to say that the website was never meant to be deployed and is mainly to showcase elements of social network such as a friendlist, a news feed, messages, private/public groups and more. </h2>
