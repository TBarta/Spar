<h1> Social network for finding sparring partners </h1>
<h2> This was my final project of Data4You coding bootcamp in Prague </h2>
<p> Backend of the website is written in PHP framework Laravel and frontend contains only some basic bootstrap</p>
<p> It's fair to say that the website was never meant to be deployed and is mainly to showcase elements of social network such as a friendlist, a news feed, messages, private/public groups and more. </p>
